# About me

Hello! I'm Gustavo Bovo, a Brazilian solo indie game developer. I've been passionate about playing, designing, and writing narratives and game ideas since I was a kid. By 2022, I decided to take this passion more seriously, dedicating my free time to learning programming and experimenting with various game engines and frameworks. Recently, I made the leap by participating in my first game jam and starting my own Reddit community to share my experiences and help other aspiring game developers.

# Put Them On The Scale!

In August 2024, I participated in my first game jam, GMTK's Game Jam 2024 edition, one of the largest of the year, with over 31,000 confirmed participants and more than 7,600 games submitted by the event's end.

[Put Them On The Scale!](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2889944) has ranked #2604, standing at the top 35% best-ranked games. 

The project was developed in approximately 40 hours of focused work (excluding rest). Despite the pressure of delivering within the jam's 96-hour timeframe and the challenges of developing my first game solo, I successfully completed and submitted it within the deadline.

Here is some feedback collected from the itch.io page for this project:

> "For a first game, it's really cool, and the theme is well implemented. Congrats!"
> — MarcoP

> "Cute and entertaining game! I could easily picture this as a desktop toy to fiddle around with whenever I need a break from work!"
> — ZeusSusie

> "This is pretty good for a first ever jam! It's a bit buggy, but that's to be expected in a game jam. Overall good work :)"
> — grizzy games

"Put Them On The Scale!" is a physics-based game where players stack various vehicles to try and reach the moon. Designed to be a fun and light-hearted experience, it incorporates the jam theme "Built to Scale" with a unique twist.

Here is an excerpt from my _post-mortem_ posted on my Reddit community – [Finding and Maintaining Scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/visions_ofBlack_Skies/comments/1f2m5i7/finding_and_maintaining_scale_a_gmtk_game_jam/):

> My goal was to create a game about a mad scientist who invented the world’s greatest weighing scale. But no one believed him, so he set out to prove it by using his Matter Manipulator gun to throw as many objects as possible onto his scale.

> I really tried to play with the word 'scale,' exploring its various meanings – from scaly animals to stretching objects and measuring things. Initially, I fixated on an idea involving a pangolin (an anteater with scales) that would build objects onto its scales to become bigger and stronger. However, I struggled to find a fun way to execute this concept. After hours of brainstorming and a bit of frustration, I finally landed on the idea of a weighing scale that could measure the weight of anything placed on it, allowing players to create a towering behemoth while trying to keep everything balanced.
