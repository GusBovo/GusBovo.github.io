# About me

Hello! I’m Gustavo Bovo, a Brazilian solo indie game developer. I've been passionate about playing, designing, and writing game narratives since childhood. In 2022, I decided to take this passion seriously, dedicating my free time to learning programming and experimenting with various game engines and frameworks. Recently, I participated in my first game jam and started a Reddit community to share my experiences and help other aspiring game developers.

# Put Them On The Scale!

In August 2024, I participated in GMTK’s Game Jam 2024, one of the largest jams of the year, with over 31,000 confirmed participants and more than 7,600 game submissions.

[Put Them On The Scale!](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2889944) ranked #2604, placing it in the top 35% of all games submitted.

"Put Them On The Scale!" is a physics-based game where players stack various vehicles in an attempt to reach the moon. Designed to be a fun and light-hearted experience, it incorporates the jam’s theme, “Built to Scale,” with a unique twist.

The game was developed over approximately 40 hours of focused work (excluding rest). Despite the challenges of working solo under the pressure of a 96-hour deadline, I successfully completed and submitted the project on time.

Here’s some feedback from the game’s itch.io page:

> "For a first game, it's really cool, and the theme is well implemented. Congrats!"
> — MarcoP

> "Cute and entertaining game! I could easily picture this as a desktop toy to fiddle around with whenever I need a break from work!"
> — ZeusSusie

> "This is pretty good for a first ever jam! It's a bit buggy, but that's to be expected in a game jam. Overall good work :)"
> — grizzy games

Here's an excerpt from my _post-mortem_ posted on my Reddit community – [Finding and Maintaining Scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/visions_ofBlack_Skies/comments/1f2m5i7/finding_and_maintaining_scale_a_gmtk_game_jam/):

> My goal was to create a game about a mad scientist who invented the world’s greatest weighing scale. But no one believed him, so he set out to prove it by using his Matter Manipulator gun to stack as many objects as possible onto the scale.

> I played with the word "scale," exploring its multiple meanings — from scaly animals to the concept of measurement. At first, I fixated on an idea involving a pangolin (an anteater with scales) that would build objects onto its scales to grow bigger and stronger. However, I struggled to make that concept fun. After hours of brainstorming, I landed on the idea of a weighing scale that could measure anything placed on it, allowing players to build a towering structure while trying to maintain balance.
