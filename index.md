# About me

I've been passionate about playing, designing, and writing narratives and game ideas since I was a kid. By 2022, I decided to take this passion more seriously, dedicating my free time to learning programming and experimenting with various game engines and frameworks. Recently, I made the leap by participating in my first game jam and starting my own Reddit community to share my experiences and help other aspiring game developers.

# Put Them On The Scale!

In August 2024, I participated in my first game jam, GMTK's Game Jam 2024 edition, one of the largest of the year, with over 31,000 confirmed participants and more than 7,600 games submitted by the event's end.

[Put Them On The Scale!](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024/rate/2889944) has ranked #2604, standing at the top 35% best-ranked games. 

The project was developed in approximately 40 hours of focused work (excluding rest). Despite the pressure of delivering within the jam's 96-hour timeframe and the challenges of developing my first game solo, I successfully completed and submitted it within the deadline.

Here is some feedback collected from the itch.io page for this project:

"For a first game, it's really cool, and the theme is well implemented. Congrats!"
— MarcoP

"Cute and entertaining game! I could easily picture this as a desktop toy to fiddle around with whenever I need a break from work!"
— ZeusSusie

"This is pretty good for a first ever jam! It's a bit buggy, but that's to be expected in a game jam. Overall good work :)"
